Digging is a web app that shows the user the place they would end up if start digging a hole right now! Without passing through the center of the Earth because they would not survive. So keeping it real, the hole goes to the opposite meridians but on the same parallel.

Learning goal:
More practice with Ruby on Rails and APIs
Get to know Google APIs


##Using the app
The search bar is powered by Google Maps, so user can either enter an address or the name of a city or a country.
The origin box displays the full address, latitude, longitude, and the Google Street View image.
The destination box displays same data, but the image is a Google Places Picture, and if this is not available, a Google Static Map.

Users can log in with Google account, authenticated users are able to save holes!!
